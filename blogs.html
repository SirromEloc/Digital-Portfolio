      <h1>3-May-2023: AISD removing BYOD</h1>
      <p> Recently, Allen ISD has released an statement announcing that starting next semester (Fall 2023), they "will discontinue the use of the BYOD computer device policy," meaning that they will no longer allow their students to use personal computer devices while on campus. While an obvious attempt to limit cheating in the light of new AI powered programs, this poses a serious question to the extent which they can punish bad-acters, before harming the general public. <br\> The schools infrastructure is already limited, and though they claim the WIFI will be strong enough to support all 21,000+ students, this seems outright ridiculous and unable to be stated. It is already common that the school provided services hiccup and stop when a large amount of students attempt to use it at one time. Along side this change in policy, they are removing the seperate BYOD WIFI channel. Many students rely on this WIFI to message their family or perform extracurricular activities from their phone, many ofwhich cannot be done from the school computers. Now additionally, the school computers are only another cost the school has to upkeep throughtout the years, updating and replacing old/broken models when they inevitably become useless. This change in policy seems to simply be a piss-poor bandage to stop the flood of new changes in the coming world. </p>
