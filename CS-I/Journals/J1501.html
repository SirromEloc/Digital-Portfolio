      1.1: What do you observe?<br/>
      The text “Hello, World!” appeared in the top left corner of the screen.
    </p> <p>
      1.2: How large is the text?<br/>
      The text is fairly small 
    </p> <p>
      2.1: What do you observe?<br/>
      The text has grown a lot
    </p> <p>
      2.2: How large is the text now?<br/>
      30 point font
    </p> <p>
      3.1:What do you observe?<br/>
      A rectangle has drawn around the text
    </p> <p>
      3.2:What is the purpose of the location parameter in the Text constructor?<br/>
      To let the computer know where to draw the text
    </p> <p>
      3.3:What is the corresponding parameter named in the Rectangle?<br/>
      topLeft: parameter
    </p> <p>
      3.4:What is the difference between a Rect and a Rectangle? Hint: Are you able to render a Rect?<br/>
      Rect was a value that was assigned to the property rectangle. Rect cannot be rendered without assigning it to a property first
    </p> <p>
      What did I learn? What is the "big idea"?<br/>
      That classes allows you to group together objects and execute their set up, such as rendering them
    </p> <p>
      What challenges did I encounter?<br/>
      Understanding that some properties come from the hidden parent class from the library
    </p> <p>
      How could this experience be improved?<br/>
      less confusing naming for the properties and values, such as "rect" and "rectangle", with an explaination of how they are different
    </p> <p>
      Free Reflection: How has what I've learned affected my thinking?<br/>
      This has really let me understand classes better, before I would see them in code and get really confused
