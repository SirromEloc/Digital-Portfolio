      1.1: What do you observe? <br/>
      A horizontal blue line
    </p> <p>
      1.2: What is the purpose of LineWidth? <br/>
      Sets the width of the line when it is drawn
    </p> <p>
      1.3: Why do we draw lines with StrokeStyle rather than FillStyle?<br/>
      A line doesnâ€™t have internal area to do anything with, it is rather the 2D plane such like the outline on a shape
    </p> <p>
      2.1: What do you observe? <br/>
      A downturned blue outline of a triangle
    </p> <p>
      2.2: Which statements draw the triangle?<br/>
      The initial defining statement of the lines variable, and the following statements defining a new ending point
    </p> <p>
      2.3: What would happen without line 10 (in the above listing)? <br/>
      Only the top and right sides of the triangle would be drawn (the original ending point becoming the start for the next line)
    </p> <p>
      3.1: What do you observe?<br/>
      A purple ellipse has drawn itself around the triangle
    </p> <p>
      3.2: Why do you think the class Ellipse is used to draw a circle?<br/>
      Ellipse is and round shape, and a circle is just a elliptical shape with an equal width all the way around
    </p> <p>
      3.3: What is the purpose of radiusX and radiusY?<br/>
      To determine the vertical and horizontal width
    </p> <p>
      What did I learn? What is the "big idea"?<br/>
      Lines and ellipses can be drawn similarly to rectangles 
    </p> <p>
      What challenges did I encounter?<br/>
      none, easy to learn article
    </p> <p>
      How could this experience be improved?<br/>
      Purhapse a better explaination of what happens when the .lineto is used but the change and learn encourages experimental learning
    </p> <p>
      Free Reflection: How has what I've learned affected my thinking?<br/>
      Thinking about how I can draw connecting lines
