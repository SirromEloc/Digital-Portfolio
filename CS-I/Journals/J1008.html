      1.1:<br/>
      "Outside of Merlin"
    </p> <p>
      2.1:<br/>
      "Merlin Root"
    </p> <p>
      2.2:<br/>
      That I am in the biggest, main, Merlin directory (the root directory). Then it also executes the command if viable. For "merlin list" it displays all the missions I can prepare, eligble date, accepted date, due date, expiration date, and whether its completed.
    </p> <p>
      3.1:<br/>
      at first "ls" displays nothing because there is nothing in the directory, after "merlin prepare", the "ls" command displays all the  missions listed when I ran the "merlin list" command.
    </p> <p>
      3.2:<br/>
      The "prepare" command creates the files I have access to through CoderMerlin into my personal directories
    </p> <p>
      4.1:<br/>
      It created the "instructions.txt" and the other proper files needed to complete the challenge
    </p> <p>
      4.2:<br/>
      The "merlin prepare" command creates the files in the personal directory. Depending on what directory it is ran, it either creates the missions and files or the files inside to complete them
    </p> <p>
      What did I learn? What is the "big idea"?<br/>
      I learned how the Merlin Mission Manager operates and how to complete missions
    </p> <p>
      What challenges did I encounter?<br/>
      Sometimes I forgot to prepare or execute the commands in the correct order
    </p> <p>
      How could this experience be improved?<br/>
      The examples of the executed commands in the wiki were not formatted correctly depending on the window size and diamentions
    </p> <p>
      Free Reflection: How has what I've learned affected my thinking?<br/>
      While annoying, the prepare command allows for lots of freedom as you can delete and modify the files however you want and get back the originals back easily.
