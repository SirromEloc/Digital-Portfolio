      1.1: Why do you think Hello World is typically the first program taught to students?<br/>
      The program is simple to create with a visible and easy to understand output
    </p> <p>
      1.2: How might the Hello World program be different, depending on the programming language it's written in?<br/>
      The structure and syntax to run the print command or even the command would change greatly depending on the language.
    </p> <p>
      What did I learn? What is the "big idea"?<br/>
      I did not know that "hello, world" was originally written in C and learned that the creator's name is Brian Kernighan. The mission showed me the structure of lots of languages and how each language is specialized.
    </p> <p>
      What challenges did I encounter?<br/>
      None really. The article was like 2 paragraphs long and the mission was simple enough that I understood. Biggest problem was delegating another character in length for the Assembly code.
    </p> <p>
      How could this experience be improved?<br/>
      For the mission, some commented explainations of what the parts of the code does in the languages with unfamiliar structures
    </p> <p>
      Free Reflection: How has what I've learned affected my thinking?<br/>
     I think its interesting how long the same basic program has been popular to create, starting all the way back in the 70snearly 50 years at the time of writing
