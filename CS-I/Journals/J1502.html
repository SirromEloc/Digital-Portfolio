      1.1: What do you observe? <br/>
      A tall blue rectangle
    </p> <p>
      1.2: Is the rectangle wider than it is tall or taller than it is wide? Why?<br/>
      No, it is taller than wide because the width was 200 and the height was 300
    </p> <p>
      1.3: Is the rectangle filled or only an outline? Why?<br/>
      It is filled because it uses a fillStyle instead of .stroke
    </p> <p>
      1.4: What color is the rectangle? Why is it that specific shade rather than a similar color?<br/>
      The rectangle is blue because it selected the pre-made .blue color, shade of zero red or green value and max blue value
    </p> <p>
      2.1: What do you observe?<br/>
      Green outline of a rectangle
    </p> <p>
      2.2: Is the rectangle filled or only an outline? Why?<br/>
      Only an outline because a .stroke fillMode was used
    </p> <p>
      2.3: What color is the rectangle? Why is it that specific shade rather than a similar color?<br/>
      It is Green, from the pre-made shade of 0 red and blue and max green value
    </p> <p>
      3.1: What do you observe?<br/>
      A thicker green outline of a rectangle
    </p> <p>
      3.2: How has the appearance of the rectangle changed from the previous section? Why?<br/>
      The pixel width of the stroke has grown to 5 pixels
    </p> <p>
      4.1: What do you observe?<br/>
      A green rectangle with a blue outline
    </p> <p>
      4.2: How has the appearance of the rectangle changed from the previous section? Why?<br/>
      It is now filled with the color green and retains the outline over top (now blue)
    </p> <p>
      What did I learn? What is the "big idea"?<br/>
      How some of the "renderables" are only modifiers that apply to whatever shape is rendered after
    </p> <p>
      What challenges did I encounter?<br/>
      None, A simple and easy to understand lesson
    </p> <p>
      How could this experience be improved?<br/>
      purhapse have the student fill in their own color instead of only using pre-made ones
    </p> <p>
      Free Reflection: How has what I've learned affected my thinking?<br/>
      I better picture and know the process of drawing images on screen
