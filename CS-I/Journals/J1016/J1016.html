      What did I learn? What is the "big idea"?<br/>
      I learned about how to create gates using NAND Gates, cannonical representation, and De Morgans Laws
    </p> <p>
      What challenges did I encounter?<br/>
      Creating optimised gates, I could fairly easily create functional gates, but they were bloated and ineffecient
    </p> <p>
      How could this experience be improved?<br/>
      An example on how to reverse engineer gates 
    </p> <p>
      Free Reflection: How has what I've learned affected my thinking?<br/>
      I tried to create the gates through brute force and thinking but it became much easier when I worked in reverse until I reached output tables that I knew how to create
