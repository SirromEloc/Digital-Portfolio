      1.1: Compare this behavior (repeat-while loop) to that of the while loop. What are the similarities? What are the differences?<br/>
      In the repeat-while loop , the code will always be run atleast 1 time. The conditional is being tested after the code is already run
    </p> <p>
      1.2: What are the minimum number of times that this loop will execute? <br/>
      One time
    </p> <p>
      1.3: What is the purpose of the Jump instruction after the consequent? <br/>
      To restart the loop and run the code again
    </p> <p>
      2.1: Are you able to implement the same functionality found in a while loop using a repeat-while loop, without changing the condition or adding a conditional? Explain and provide an example. <br/>
      No it cannot guarunteed because a while loop will not always run the code. Such as when needing to run a program until the user specifies, with a while loop sometimes the program may not even start but a repeat-while loop with execute it atleast once till specified
    </p> <p>
      2.2: Are you able to implement the same functionality found in a repeat-while loop using a while loop, without changing the condition or adding a conditional? Explain and provide an example. <br/>
      No because the code must always repeat atleast once, for example if the code was for an automatic door, everytime the door attempts to check for a person, with a repeat-while loop, the door would open even without a person there
    </p> <p>
      What did I learn? What is the "big idea"?<br/>
      Differences between repeat-while loops and while loops
    </p> <p>
      What challenges did I encounter?<br/>
      none
    </p> <p>
      How could this experience be improved?<br/>
      Some real world examples for each kind of loop
    </p> <p>
      Free Reflection: How has what I've learned affected my thinking?<br/>
      I really understand the flexiblilty that assembly language and low level programing allows
