      1.1: What do you observe? <br/>
      A curved black line
    </p> <p>
      1.2: What is the purpose of the parameters startAngle and endAngle?<br/>
      State what arc of a circle will drawn in radians
    </p> <p>
      1.3: In which direction do you think the arc is being drawn (clockwise or counterclockwise)?<br/>
      Drawn Clockwise (just makes more sense I think)
    </p> <p>
      1.4: How can you test your hypothesis?<br/>
      Editing the start and end angles and seeing which side of the arc is effected
    </p> <p>
      2.1: What do you observe? <br/>
      An eye shaped outline
    </p> <p>
      2.2: Note that there is only a single canvas.render() statement. How does this single statement result in the rendering of two arcs?<br/>
      The .arc primitive adds to the original object and the render statement renders the whole object
    </p> <p>
      3.1: What do you observe?<br/>
      The eye outline is now colored on the inside
    </p> <p>
      3.2: Which line number determines whether or not this Path is filled?<br/>
      Line 10 that renders the path also determines if it is colored in by rendering the outerFillColor rule before rendering the path
    </p> <p>
      4.1: What do you observe?<br/>
      The eye image now has a iris
    </p> <p>
      4.2: The outerPath contains two arcs and each specifies a startAngle and endAngle. These angles aren't specified explicitly for the innerPath. What are the default angles in this case?<br/>
      The default angles would be 0 and 2pi, or about 6.28, or the full circle
    </p> <p>
      5.1: What do you observe?<br/>
      There are now 2 lashes on the eye
    </p> <p>
      5.2: Is a path necessarily constructed of a single, continuous line?<br/>
      No, not always continuous, but as far as the computer knows, they are in the same object
    </p> <p>
      What did I learn? What is the "big idea"?<br/>
      Arcs can be drawn as part circles, and combined to create more complex shapes
    </p> <p>
      What challenges did I encounter?<br/>
      Understanding the start and end angles are in radians, and that the arc was even being created from a circle
    </p> <p>
      How could this experience be improved?<br/>
      Purhapse having a grid being displayed as well to understand exactly where the coordinates are and how they relate to the arc
    </p> <p>
      Free Reflection: How has what I've learned affected my thinking?<br/>
      Multiple arcs being apart of the same object, yet discontinuous has me wondering how the computer processes the code, and what situations will things like filling in color work
