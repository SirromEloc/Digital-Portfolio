      1.1:<br/>
Starting at the value of the 1st number's least significant figure, increase its value by the 2nd number's least significant figure. Continue this and repeat with the next significant figures in order. If the value of 2 numerals increase to more than the base, remove the value equivalent to the base from the result and add 1 to the sum of the next sigificant figure's addition.
    </p> <p>
      2.1:<br/>
      In an octal system the base is 8, meaning that the largest figure is 7, and when the addends sum up to larger than 7 you must carry a 1 over
    </p> <p>
      3.1:<br/>
      In hexadecimal, the base is 16 so the largest figure is F (value of 15). You must not carry over until the value of the sum is larger than F (15)
    </p> <p>
      4.1:<br/>
      In binary the base is 2, meaning the value of each place is either 0 or 1. Addition of any 2 figures with value will always result in a carry over into the next place.
    </p> <p>
      What did I learn? What is the "big idea"?<br/>
      I learned how to add in many different bases and understand how they operate compared to decimal
    </p> <p>
      What challenges did I encounter?<br/>
      I had some trouble remembering the value of the hexadecimal numerals past 9.
    </p> <p>
      How could this experience be improved?<br/>
      Maybe more naturally visualized display of the addition instead of the charts and wordy explainations
    </p> <p>
      Free Reflection: How has what I've learned affected my thinking?<br/>
      Numbers and digits are individual ideas, and don't always equal the same thing while in different bases.
