	<h3> The Roles: </h3>
	<p>Software Development Engineer: Software engineers are the people who deal with the creation of programs by actually designing and coding the software. As of right now, I do not belive I would be a very good development engineer because my knowledge on computer science and engineering principals are fairly limited. I can improve in this area by continuing to enroll in computer science classes to study and by gaining experience over time. </p>
	<p>QA Engineer: QA engineers or quality assurance are the people who test software for bugs and ease of use. QA engineers implement and execute test plans to ensure good functionality of the product and that it fills all the requirements. I believe I would be a good QA tester because I enjoy breaking and testing things while I am good at communicating my ideas to other people. I expect that our software will act in many unexpected ways which we will then work to fix.</p>
	<p>Project Manager: The project manager is the person who coordinates and oversees the complete development of the project. They ensure the team members are doing what they are supposed to and everything can be completed on a proper schedule. I do not think I would be a very good project manager because though I am good at communication, my time management and scheduling abilities are poor. It is likely that the project deadline will approach near and the project manager must be able to delegate work and cut what is needed for the project to be completed.</p>
	<p>Product Manager: The product manager is the person responsible for defining and explaining the scope of the project, what is needed to completed, and ensuring that the final result is what was expected. I believe I would be a good project manager because I am good at communicating my ideas and pre-visualizing concept in my mind. We will definitely need to make a proper plan for the project and form a cohesive idea across all team members. </p>
	<p>Release Engineer: The release engineer are the final oversight on a product as they manage, and organize every part of the project. They ensure that all code and development use consistent methods and practices throughout and make sure that every release of the code remains accessible and useable in the same way. A simple problem a release engineer may face is inconsistent syntax or flagging, making the code harder to read. I would not be suitable for this role because it relys on detail awareness and organization, of which I have little.
