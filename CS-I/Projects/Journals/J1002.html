1.1:<br/>
Everything on the WorldWideWeb, such as Youtube or Instagram to even the AHS webpage. Most Multiplayer videogames such as WoW or Fortnite<br/>
<br/>   
2.1:<br/>
Allows for better organization between directories and allows code to more easily access similar data in different locations if coordinated properly<br/>
<br/>
3.1:<br/>
To save space and so it’s easily identifiable. To remind that you shouldn’t go higher in the directory<br/>
<br/>
4.1:<br/>
The prompts changed to show the current directory so the user knows where they are working<br/>
<br/>
5.1:<br/>
Up arrow goes to previous commands in order, Down arrow returns to the next commands<br/>
<br/>
6.1:<br/>
“Hello World” was not printed because it was outputed into the text file<br/>
<br/>
7.1:<br/>
“ls” shows directories and files in the current directory, “tree” shows the layout of every directory and every file<br/>
<br/>
7.2:<br/>
If I am searching how to go lower in a directory I would use “ls”. If I needed to find a specific item on the entire computer I would use “tree”<br/>
<br/>
8.1:<br/>
The argument is the amount of time to wait in seconds (flashes of the cursor)<br/>
<br/>
8.2:<br/>
Counting the number of flashes after the “sleep” shows it is the same as the argument. And using an external timer shows that a “10” argument waits 10 seconds<br/>
<br/>
9.1:<br/>
A number is displayed and I can continue enter commands immediately<br/>
<br/>
9.2:<br/>
The job is completed while allowing the user to start new jobs or use the commandline<br/>
<br/>
9.3:<br/>
The number job the process is. In order they were started<br/>
<br/>
10.1:<br/>
The jobs display “Running” and then “Done” and then disappear<br/>
<br/>
10.2:<br/>
“Running” is displayed while the sleep command is waiting and after the argued amount of time is waited, the job displays “Done” for one instance to tell the user it has completed. The job then disappears as it has no use anymore<br/>
<br/>
What did I learn? What is the "big idea"?<br/>
The shell is a powerful tool with many different uses.<br/>
<br/>
What challenges did I encounter?<br/>
A few times I would accidentally hit a key or enter a command, locking me into a mode I did not know how to exit or doing something I did not know how to undo<br/>
<br/>
How could this experience be improved?<br/>
Deeper explainations of specific commands and their use cases with examples. Not specifically to learn everything but to provide me guidance on how I could put what I have learned together.<br/>
<br/>
Free Reflection: How has what I've learned affected my thinking?<br/>
I am starting to feel comfortable with the shell and its uses but I am also becoming aware of everything I do not know. Bottom of the learning curve confidence </p>
