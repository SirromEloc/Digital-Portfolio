      1.1:<br/>
      The symbol is crossed out 3 lines because 3 lines was used for equivalence and exclusive disjunction is the direct opposite of equivalence. Instead of a 4th line added for negation, the symbol was crossed out.

      2.1:<br/>
      For every input the number of rows doubles (1 input, 2 rows; 2 inputs, 4 rows; 3 inputs, 8 rows), so the formula 2n with n being the number of inputs results in the number rows.

      What did I learn? What is the "big idea"?<br/>
      I learned about the concept of boolean algebra, truth tables, canonical representation, and De Morgan's Laws
    </p> <p>
      What challenges did I encounter?<br/>
      I do not understand the realistic use cases of truth tables and canonical representation. They lay out all the information in a neat matter but I am unsure how they are useful
    </p> <p>
      How could this experience be improved?<br/>
      Examples of how the algebra is used during coding or computer science would help me better understand the reasoning behind the tables 
    </p> <p>
      Free Reflection: How has what I've learned affected my thinking?<br/>
      I believe I understand how logic works, and it interests me how the different operations can interact. I think I was able to understand the actual operations well because it is similar minecraft redstone that I learned about when I was younger.
