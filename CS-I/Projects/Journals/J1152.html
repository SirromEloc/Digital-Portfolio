      1.1: Why is the test executed prior to the loop?<br/>
      To be able to skip the loop from begining if the conditonal isn't true
    </p> <p>
      1.2: Compare this diagram to that of the conditional. What are the similarities? What are the differences? <br/>
      They both have the same parts but the jump at the end of the consequent jumps back to the begining of the while loop instead of after the alternative like the conditional does.
    </p> <p>
      1.3: What is the purpose of the Jump instruction after the consequent? <br/>
      to restart the loop
    </p> <p>
      What did I learn? What is the "big idea"?<br/>
      Structure of a while loop, and I learned that it is actually very similar to a conditional
    </p> <p>
      What challenges did I encounter?<br/>
      None
    </p> <p>
      How could this experience be improved?<br/>
      It was clear and simple, I see no improvements needed
    </p> <p>
      Free Reflection: How has what I've learned affected my thinking?<br/>
      I am starting to really understand assembly better
