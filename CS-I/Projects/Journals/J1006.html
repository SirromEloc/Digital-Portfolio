      1.1:<br/>
      The info about the current saved gits<br/>
      <br/>
	1.2:<br/>
	The comment descriptor text I added is displayed with the git info<br/>
	<br/>
	1.3:<br/>
	This is for quick references of the saved gits and what they contain<br/>
	<br/>
	2.1: <br/>
	They are displayed in red, file1 as modified. <br/>
	<br/>
	2.2: <br/>
	They are displayed in separate sections because file2 has not been added to the git<br/>
	<br/>
	3.1: <br/>
	They are both displayed as green, file1 as modified and file2 as a new file<br/>
	<br/>
	3.2:<br/>
	They are both displayed mostly the same, except for the modified and new file tags<br/>
	<br/>
	4.1:<br/>
	The 2 files are listed as changed, file 1 and 2<br/>
	<br/>
	4.2:<br/>
	They each state lines we added in the files displayed in green<br/>
	<br/>
	5.1:<br/>
	Git tells me nothing has changed, purhapse i did it wrong but this section in codermerlin is broken<br/>
	
<br/>
What did I learn? What is the "big idea"?<br/>
How to use and utilize Git in my projects<br/>
<br/>
What challenges did I encounter?<br/>
Getting the git diff command to display after already commiting. it makes sense to me why it wouldn't work but thats what it says to do in the wiki<br/>
<br/>
How could this experience be improved?<br/>
Several parts of the article were broken or slightly unclear. Someone with more knowledge on how to format the wiki needs to edit the article and fix it<br/>
<br/>
Free Reflection: How has what I've learned affected my thinking?<br/>
I understand the usefulness of GIT and it makes me confident to make mistakes while i go forward to code </p>
