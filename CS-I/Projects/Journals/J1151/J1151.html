      1.1: How does branching enable significantly more complex program behavior?<br/>
      Branching allows programs to adapt to its current circumstances and many situations
    </p> <p>
      1.2: Why do you think the term 'consequent' is used to refer to the statements that are executed when the Boolean test evalutes to true?<br/>
      The executing statements would be run as a direct result of the state specified in the conditional, or consequently
    </p> <p>
      2.1: Why is the first jump conditional? What determines whether the jump will be executed or not? <br/>
      The first jump is conditional because it should only jump to run certain code if the right condition is met. This jump is determined on what the value in the rax register is, specifically if the 2nd number compared is less than or equal to it.
    </p> <p>
      2.2: What is the purpose of the jump intruction after the consequent?<br/>
      The jump after consequent is to skip the code that should only be run if the previous output was alternative
    </p> <p>
      2.3: Why is there no need for a corresponding jump instruction after the alternative?<br/>
      There is no need for a jump because the code will continue to execute sequentially, and the consequent processes are before the alternative processes in the memory
    </p> <p>
      What did I learn? What is the "big idea"?<br/>
      I learned about the structure of flowcharts and how jumps can be coded in assembly
    </p> <p>
      What challenges did I encounter?<br/>
      At first I had trouble understanding how conditional jumps operated because in my mind the jle was jumping to the 'alternative' opposite than what I expected, until I took a moment to understand the flags it checked for
    </p> <p>
      How could this experience be improved?<br/>
      The explanatory diagram for conditional jumps in the wiki is confusing and the colored arrows do not help as they were inteded
    </p> <p>
      Free Reflection: How has what I've learned affected my thinking?<br/>
      I have gained respect for how basic original assembly coding was and I think the limitations allowed for very clever solutions to what I would've assumed to be basic problems.
